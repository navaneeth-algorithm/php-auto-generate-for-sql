# php-auto-generate-for-sql

This is SQL file Parser and PHP Query Generator .

Auto generated Database Connection Template and the Ajax Code for the Client Side based on the attributes of the Table.

It also parses and fetches table Names,Attributes of that table.

Also generate Database Connection Template, Insert Query Template .

Now its just developing...My Focus is to Auto Generate Query for PHP and Ajax.So The Front End and Backened caan be easily written.

Here autophp.sql is just a sample sql file for sqlParser.py.
Instead you can give your own .sql file to the python 
For more see the generated dbConnect.php and Project.php which are generated by my sqlParser.py

If you have doubt regarding it ,

Run 
python sqlParser.py --filename autophp.sql --tablename Client --template True

<b>Here without Template option file never gets generated</b>
